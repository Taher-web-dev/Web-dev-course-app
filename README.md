# Capstone project 1 : Web developement course app 
For this project, I've created simple responsive site for a CMS developement course. Thus, I created home and about page with html and css. I've created menu and speakers section using javascript. I think that this work can be very useful either for someone who want to hold a confernce or a course web site, or web developement practioner.
